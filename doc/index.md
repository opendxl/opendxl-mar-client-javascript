## Overview

The
[McAfee Active Response](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/active-response.html)
(MAR) DXL JavaScript client library provides a high level wrapper for the MAR
[Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx)
(DXL) API.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to perform MAR searches without
having to focus on lower-level details such as MAR-specific DXL topics and
message formats.
